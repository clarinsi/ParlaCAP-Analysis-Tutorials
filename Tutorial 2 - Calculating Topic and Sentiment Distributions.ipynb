    "# Tutorial 2 - Topic & Sentiment Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this tutorial is to perform **Exploratoy Data Analysis (EDA)** on the ParlaMint dataset, focusing on a descriptive overview of **policy topics (CAP categories)** and **sentiment** in parliamentary debates. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible research questions are:**\n",
    "- *Which CAP categories dominate parliamentary debates, and does the distribution differ across countries?*\n",
    "- *How does average sentiment vary by topic and by country?*\n",
    "- *Do party affiliation or coalition status influence the tone of debates?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, the notebook introduces a series of visualizations and summary statistics:\n",
    "- **Histograms and barplots** of CAP category distributions across parliaments\n",
    "- **Sentiment distributions** for individual topics within a single country and across all countries\n",
    "- **Comparisons of distributions by party status** (Coalition vs. Opposition)\n",
    "- **Tables summarizing average sentiment** by topic and country, with export options (TSV) for further research\n",
    "- **Scatterplots** linking topic prominence and sentiment, highlighting correlations between how much a topic is discussed and the tone in which it is discussed\n"

    "\n",
    "This tutorial has provided a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the ParlaMint dataset, while addressing fundamental questions regarding the distribution of policy topics and sentiment across parliaments. The key findings reveal interesting patterns and indicate country-specific nuances in parliamentary discourse. In summary, we looked at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CAP category patterns**: Topics such as 'Macroeconomics', 'Government Operations' and 'Law and Crime' dominate debates across the selected parliaments (RS, HR, HU).\n",
    "- **Sentiment trends**: Neutral and negative sentiment generally dominate parliamentary debates. Positive tone is identified as the least common, indicating that parliaments are primarily criticism and heated discussions as a form of expression (rather than praise or affirmation).\n",
    "- **Party & coalition influence**: In the analysis of Serbia (RS), coalition parties dominate the quantity of speech and tend to employ a more neutral tone, while opposition parties speak less overall and contribute a disproportionally high share of negative sentiment.\n",
    "- **Topic prominence vs. sentiment**: The scatterplot reveals that topics receiving greater attention are discussed more negatively, though some countries might display a more balanced distribution if looked at separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next Tutorial (**Tutorial 3**), we will build on the descriptive analyses from this Tutorial and move towards a more comparative approach, using cosine distance to systematically measure how similar or different parliamentary discourses are across countries."
