    "# Tutorial 1 - First steps with ParlaMint dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this **hands-on tutorial exploring the ParlaMint dataset**, a rich multilingual corpus of European parliamentary debates. This tutorial is designed for researchers, data scientists and political science enthusiasts who want to analyze parliamentary proceedings across different European countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **ParlaMint dataset** is a comprehensive and multilingual corpus of transcribed speeches from different European parliaments. It serves as a valuable resource for computational social science and digital humanities research. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, ParlaMint contains the full text of parliamentary speeches annotated with rich metadata, including the speaker's role (e.g. *Member of Parliament*), political party affiliation, date of the session and the length of each speech. This foundational data was significantly expanded with **CAP categories** and **sentiment scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the ParlaCAP component categorizes all available speech segments into a specific policy domain from the **Comparative Agendas Project (CAP)**, e.g. healthcare, education or foreign affairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the **ParlaSent** extension provides detailed **sentiment scores** for each segment, allowing researchers to analyze the emotional tone of the debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset's power lies in its comparative design. It covers **multiple countries** and spans different time periods, enabling cross-parliament analysis. This makes ParlaMint very useful for **comparative political research**, allowing users to systematically study the differences in e.g. political discourse or policy priorities, across nations. Besides that, its structure makes it ideal for technical applications like **topic modeling** and **sentiment analysis** on a large scale.\n",

    "**Note: Dataset size and memory management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we load the data, it's important to understand its scale. We are working with 28 country-specific datasets, which together represent a very large corpus of parliamentary speech. The individual files in your directory vary in size. We can group them into four broad categories:\n",
    "- **Small datasets (< 50 MB)**: Including countries like Sweden (SE) and Spain's regional parliaments (ES-CT, ES-GA, ES-PV).\n",
    "- **Medium Datasets (50 - 150 MB)**: This is the largest category, encompassing the majority of countries such as the Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Greece (GR), and Poland (PL).\n",
    "- **Large datasets (150 - 250 MB)**: this group includes larger parliamentary bodies like those of France (FR), the United Kingdom (GB) and the Netherlands (NL).\n",
    "- **The largest dataset (> 350 MB)**: The corpus for Turkey (TR) is the single largest file at 370 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The comined size of all these files is over 2.5 GB**. However, when loaded into a Pandas DataFrame in memory, this can expand significantly, potentially requiring 8-10 GB of RAM or more if loaded without smart filtering. To prevent your computer to crash or become slow, we need to work efficiently with the data and use these two important strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimized data typed**: In the code below, we explicitly tell Python whether a column contains text, categories or numbers. This significantly reduces the amount of RAM required. For example, storing a limited set of values like 'Coalition' and 'Opposition' as a 'category' is much more efficient than storing them as text strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunked loading**: Instead of loading all the dataset files at once, we read them in smaller, manageable pieces (e.g. 50.000 rows at a time), process each piece (filtering and optimizing it) and then combine the results. This allows us to work on datasets much larger than our available RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements these strategies to ensure our analysis can run smoothly on a standard laptop."

    "\n",
    "**1. Increase CSV field size limit (preparation)**: Parliamentary speeches can be very long which can exceed Python's default maximum field size. This part adjusts Python's built-in limits to prevent errors when reading the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. & 3. Memory optimization**: Here, the code specifies exactly which columns of the datasets to load and defines the data types to reduca RAM usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Loading & processing loop**: This is the core of the script. For each country in our list, this code **reads the large dataset file in small, manageable pieces (chunks of 50.000 rows) (4.1.)**. For each chunk it adds a 'country' label, **filters speeches (4.2.)** to keep only those given by regular Members of Parliament (MP), removing technical speakers, ministers and other to focus on core parliamentary debate and **cleans the data (4.3.)** by removing rows where the policy topic (**CAP_category**) or sentiment is missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Combine the final datasets**: This part comes after all chunks from all countries have been processed and it combines everything to a final master DataFrame *filtered_all*."
