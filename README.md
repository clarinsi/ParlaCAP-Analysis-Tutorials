## Workflow Overview

The analysis workflow is organized across **five tutorials**, each building on the previous one.

## Tutorial 1 - First Steps with the ParlaMint Dataset

**Objective:**  
This tutorial introduces the **ParlaMint dataset**, a rich multilingual corpus of European parliamentary debates. It is designed for researchers, data scientists, and political science enthusiasts who want to analyze parliamentary proceedings across different European countries.

**Dataset Overview:**  
- **ParlaMint** contains transcribed parliamentary speeches annotated with detailed metadata, including speaker role (e.g., Member of Parliament), party affiliation, session date, gender and speech length.  
    + Extension: **ParlaCAP** categorizes each speech segment into a policy domain from the **Comparative Agendas Project (CAP)**, such as healthcare, education, or foreign affairs.  
    + Extension: **ParlaSent** provides sentiment scores for each segment, enabling analysis of the emotional tone of debates.


## Tutorial 2 - Topic & Sentiment Distributions

**Objective:**  
This tutorial performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the ParlaMint dataset, providing a descriptive overview of **policy topics (CAP categories)** and **sentiment** in parliamentary debates.

**Possible Research Questions:**  
- Which CAP categories dominate parliamentary debates, and do distributions differ across countries?  
- How does average sentiment vary by topic and country?  
- Does party affiliation or coalition status influence the tone of debates?

**Analyses & Visualizations used in this Tutorial:**  
- **Histograms and barplots** showing CAP category distributions across parliaments  
- **Sentiment distributions** for individual topics within a single country and across multiple countries  
- **Comparisons by party status** (Coalition vs. Opposition) to explore differences in tone between governing and opposing parties 
- **Summary tables** of average sentiment by topic and country, exportable as TSV for further research  
- **Scatterplots** linking topic prominence and sentiment, highlighting correlations between how much a topic is discussed and the tone used

This tutorial sets the foundation for cross-country comparisons and party-based analyses in subsequent tutorials.

## Tutorial 3 - Cross-Parliament Comparison

**Objective:**  
This tutorial extends the analysis from **Tutorial 2** by moving from descriptive, country-specific observations to **quantitative comparison and clustering** of parliamentary discourse. It focuses on measuring **similarity and differences across parliaments** using computational methods from **NLP** and **Computational Linguistics**.

**Key Concept:**  
- Each country is represented as a **high-dimensional vector** where:
  - Each dimension corresponds to a **CAP category**.
  - Values can represent **total word counts** (topic prevalence) or **average sentiment** (emotional tone).  
- **Cosine distance** measures the similarity between these vectors, allowing for comparison independent of text volume.

**Research Questions:**  
- Which countries exhibit the most similar sentiment patterns across CAP categories?  
- How similar are countries in their topic distributions based on word counts?  
- For a specific CAP category, which countries have the most similar sentiment patterns?

**Analysis Steps:**  
- Introduction to **Cosine Distance**  
- Compute cosine distance between countries based on **sentiment**:
  1. Example comparison: Serbia (RS) & Croatia (HR)  
  2. All countries combined  
  3. Identify the 3 nearest neighbors for each country  
- Compute cosine distance between **topic distributions** (word counts):
  1. Example comparison: Serbia (RS) & Croatia (HR)  
  2. All countries combined  
  3. Identify the 3 nearest neighbors for each country  

**Outcome:**  
This tutorial provides a systematic, data-driven framework for **cross-parliament comparison**, revealing clusters of similar parliaments, identifying outliers, and quantifying differences in both topic focus and sentiment patterns.

## Tutorial 4 - Sentiment & Frequency of Topics over Time

**Objective:**  
This tutorial explores **temporal dynamics** in parliamentary debates, building on previous analyses of topics and sentiment. It focuses on how **topic prevalence and sentiment change over time** within and across parliaments.

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Time series analysis** allows tracking of trends over regular intervals (e.g., weekly).  
- **Average sentiment per week** highlights shifts in tone for specific topics or overall discourse.  
- **Weekly word counts** reveal the attention parliaments devote to different CAP categories over time.

**Research Questions:**  
- Are there changes in sentiment across CAP categories over time in a specific parliament (e.g., Serbia)?  
- Did sentiment change noticeably during impactful events, such as the COVID-19 outbreak?  
- How does sentiment toward a specific topic (e.g., Health) differ across countries like Serbia (RS), Croatia (HR), and Hungary (HU)?  
- How does parliamentary attention (measured via weekly word count) evolve over time for specific topics?

**Analysis Steps:**  
- Select a timeframe for analysis  
- Calculate and visualize sentiment over time for a selected country:
  1. Across all topics  
  2. For one specific topic (e.g., Health)  
- Analyze average sentiment scores by country and CAP category using heatmaps  
- Compute and visualize **average weekly word counts** for selected countries and topics  

**Outcome:**  
This tutorial provides insights into **how sentiment and topic attention evolve over time**, enabling researchers to detect peaks, dips, and shifts in parliamentary focus that may correspond to political events, crises, or debates.

## Tutorial 5 - Coalition vs. Opposition Dynamics

**Objective:**  
This tutorial combines previous analyses of **topic distributions and sentiment** to examine **party alignment**, focusing on differences between **coalition and opposition parties**. It extends the analysis from a single parliament to **multiple countries**, highlighting patterns that are robust across parliamentary systems.

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Party status (Coalition vs. Opposition)** as a lens to analyze sentiment and topic emphasis  
- **Cross-country comparison** using cosine distances, dendrograms, and nearest neighbors  
- **Relative word count differences** to quantify which parties dominate debates in each CAP category

**Research Questions:**  
- Do coalitions and oppositions across parliaments agree on which topics are important?  
- Do coalitions and oppositions across parliaments express similar sentiment for the same topics?  
- Which countries or topics show the strongest divergence in tone or focus between coalition and opposition parties?

**Analysis Steps:**  
1. Compute **mean sentiment** by country and CAP category for coalition and opposition parties  
   - Visualize with heatmaps  
   - Explore cross-country patterns using **cosine distances** and **dendrograms**  
2. Compute **topic shares** (proportion of words per CAP category) for coalition and opposition  
   - Visualize with heatmaps  
   - Analyze cross-country similarities and differences  
3. Compute **relative word count differences**  
   - Identify CAP categories or parliaments dominated by coalition or opposition speeches  

**Outcome:**  
This tutorial provides a systematic framework to analyze how **political alignment influences both the tone and focus of parliamentary debates**, allowing for cross-country comparisons and identification of both common patterns and exceptional cases.
