    "#### Tutorial 5 - Coalition vs. Opposition Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial pulls together the skills and methods we developed in the previous tutorials - analyzing **topic distributions and sentiment** - and applies them to a new focus: **party alignment**. By comparing **coalition and opposition** behaviors, we not only deepen our understanding of a single parliament (like we did in **Tutorial 2, Section 3.4**), but also scale the analysis across multiple countries. This demonstrates the **transferability of our workflow** and allows us to uncover patterns that are **robust across different parliamentary systems**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do:\n",
    "1) Compute **mean sentiment** by country and CAP category separately for coalition and opposition parties, visualize with heatmaps and examine cross-country patterns using cosine distance and dendrograms.\n",
    "2) Compute **topic shares** (proportion of words per CAP category) for coalition and opposition parties, visualize them with heatmaps and explore cross-country patterns using cosine distance and dendrograms.\n",
    "3) Analyze **relative word count differences** between coalition and opposition to see which parliaments or CAP categories are dominated by each party type.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we aim to answer **possible research questions**, such as:\n",
    "- *Do Coalitions and Oppositions across parliaments agree on what's important?*\n",
    "- *Do Coalitions and Oppositions across parliaments express similar tones on the same topic?*\n",

    "*Figure 6 shows that coalition parties speak more in **Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Italy (IT) and the Netherlands (NL)**, while opposition parties dominate in **Austria (AT), Czech Republic (CZ), Latvia (LV) and Turkey (TR)**. Differences across CAP topics are less pronounced. This indicates that volume disparities are mostly country-specific rather than topic-specific.*"

    "This notebook demonstrates how parliamentary discourse can be systematically analyzed by party stauts across multiple parliaments. By combining **sentiment analysis, topic share, cosine distances, dendrograms, nearest neighbors and relative word counts**, we identified both general patterns and country-specific behaviors. Coalition parties generally exhibit a more positive tone and speak more in certain countries, while opposition parties tend to be more critical and dominate speech volume elsewhere. Topic distributions are largely similar between coalition and opposition, but small differences emerge in outlier countries. Overall, these method provide a framework that can be useful for comparing parliamentary behavior and highlighting **shared patterns** and **distinctive cases** across European parliaments"
