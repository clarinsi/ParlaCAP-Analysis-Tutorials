    "### Tutorial 3 - Cross-Parliament Comparison \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Tutorial 2**, we used descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the topical and sentimental landscapes of individual parliaments. We asked *what* topics are discussed, *how* they are discussed and identified some interesting patterns, such as the coalition-opposition sentiment divide. These findings however, were largely qualitative and country-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial brings our analysis on another level into the area of **quantitative comparison and clustering**, which represent core tasks in **Computational Lingusitics** and **NLP** (Natural Language Processing). We move from asking *\"what is the pattern in country X?\"* to a more systematic, data-driven question: *\"How similar or different are these parliamentary discourses from one another?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we introduce a fundamental NLP method for comparing distributions: **cosine distance in a vector space model**. In this framework, each country is represented as a high-dimensional cector where:\n",
    "- Each dimension corresponds to a **CAP category** (for topical analysis)\n",
    "- The value in each dimension can be the **total word count** (to model topic prevalence) or the **average sentimnet** (to model emotional tone).\n",
    "\n",
    "By measuring the cosine distance of the angle between these country-vectors, we can quantify their similarity in discourse profile, independent of the amount of text that was produced. This allows us to:\n",
    "- **Cluster** parliaments into groups with similar discoursive focus or emotional tone. \n",
    "- **Identify nearest neighbors** to find which countries have the most similar parliamentary cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible research questions:**\n",
    "- *Which countries have the most similar sentiment patterns across CAP categories?*\n",
    "- *How similar are countries in their topic distributions based on word counts?*\n",
    "- *For a specific CAP category, which countries exhibit the most similar sentiment patterns?*\n",

    "- **Load, read and filter the Data**\n",

    "#### **1. Introduction to Cosine Distance**\n",
    "**Cosine Distance** is way of comparing **patterns** between countries, regardless of size. Instead of asking *\"which country's parliament has more speeches?\"*, it asks *\"how similar are their profiles across topics or sentiments?\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We turn each country's CAP-category-distribution or CAP x sentiment score - values into a vector and then compare the *angle* between those vectors. \n",
    "- If two countries talk about the same topics in similar proportions (or show similar sentiment patterns), their cosine distance is **small** (close together).\n",
    "- If their focus is very different, the distance is **large** (far apart).\n",
